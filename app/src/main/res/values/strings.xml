    <string name="playing_the_game_content">The game starts by choosing a random player as the first turn. It gives the player 10secs to get ready and then it shows them the letter that they are to shout a word that starts with it.
        \n\nFor example, if the current topic is “Cars”, and the game presents letter “A”, the player whose turn it currently is might shout “Aston Martin” or “Astra (Opel)”.
        \n\nPlayers only have 5secs to shout out a valid word before gameplay moves on to the next player.
        \n\nIf a player shouts a valid word, they tap the green button to get awarded a point. If not, they tap the red button to pass gameplay to the next player.
        \n\nPlay continues in this manner until all agreed to topics have been played at which point players can view the score sheet to know the winner.</string>
